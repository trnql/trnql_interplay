# trnql_interplay

In order to make this app run as expected, you need to take the following steps:

1) Download the trnql Android SDK from http://appserver.trnql.com:9090/developer_dashboard/dashboard.jsp and put the aar file in the app/libs directory

2) Sign up for a Google StreetMaps API key, which you can do by following the directions found here under the "API key" heading: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro

3) After you get the API key, go to the ImageSource.java file and put the API key in the 'SM_API_KEY' variable.
